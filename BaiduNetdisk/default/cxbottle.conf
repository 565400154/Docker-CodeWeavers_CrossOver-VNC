;; MenuRoot             Specifies where Wine should create the menu
;;                      entries for Windows applications, i.e. where
;;                      the root of the "Start Menu" should be.
;;

;;
;; MenuStrip            Specifies that the first N Windows menu levels
;;                      should be stripped. So if MenuStrip is set to
;;                      one, then a menu that would be in the 'Programs'

;;
;; BottleID             This is a unique id for this bottle. It can be
;;                      used to tag items as belonging to this bottle
;;                      and to avoid name conflicts.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Version              This is the CrossOver version that this bottle

;;
;; Encoding             This is the system character encoding that was
;;                      used when creating this bottle. In particular
;;                      this impacts the filenames created by
;;                      applications which may limit the portability of
;;                      this bottle to systems using a different
;;                      encoding.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Description          A string describing the contents of the bottle.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Template             The template this bottle is based on.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with
;;                      the syntax '${VARNAME}'.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Updater              Specifies the path to an executable to be run
;;                      to update or create the bottle from a central
;;                      shared location.
;;                      This option is typically used in multi-user
;;                      setups to create the bottle directory for
;;                      new users. If empty, then nothing is done.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with

;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; ManagedLinkType      A comma-separated list specifying the type of
;;                      link to be created for the 'Link' policy.
;;                      'Symbolic' will cause the creation of a
;;                      symbolic link while 'Hard' will cause the
;;                      creation of a hard link. If both are
;;                      specified then they are tried in turn until
;;                      one succeeds. Thus order is important.
;;
;;                      Default:    "Symbolic"
;;
;; MenuMode             If set to 'install' then the menus will
;;                      be automatically reinstalled when needed.
;;
;;                      Default:    "ignore"
;;
;; AssocMode            If set to 'install' then the associations will
;;                      be automatically reinstalled when needed.
;;
;;                      Default:    "ignore"
;;
;; NSPluginMode         If set to 'install' then the Netscape plugins
;;                      will be automatically reinstalled when needed.

;;-----< [ManagedUpdatePolicy] Section >--------------------------------
;;    This section defines the update policy for managed mode,
;;    that is how files and directories are made available to the
;;    per-user bottle stubs. The settings let you specify whether they
;;    should be linked (and thus read-only), or copied (and thus
;;    writable), ignored, etc.
;;----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ManagedUpdatePolicy]

;;-----------------< Update Policy Definition >-------------------------
;;
;; This is a set of key/value pairs.
;;
;; Each key is a regular expression which matches one or more files in
;; the current bottle. All regular expressions are case insensitive.
;; Using '^' and '$' to anchor the regular expression at the start and
;; end of the file or directory name is recommended.
;;
;; Some regular expression examples:
;;  * ^drive_c/Windows/System
;;    Matches all files and directories in 'c:\Windows\System' but also
;;    'c:\Windows\System32' or any other file or directory located in
;;    'c:\Windows' with a name starting with 'System'.
;;
;;  * ^drive_c/Windows/System/
;;    Matches all files and directories in 'c:\Windows\System'.
;;
;;  * ^drive_c/Windows/System$
;;    Matches the 'c:\Windows\System' directory but not files or
;;    directories contained therein.
;;
;;  * ^drive_c/Windows/(system|win)\.ini$
;;    Matches 'c:\Windows\System.ini' and 'c:\Windows\win.ini'.
;;
;;  * \.scr$
;;    Matches all files and directories with a '.scr' extension.
;;
;;
;; The value associated with each regular expression specifies how to
;; make corresponding the files and directories accessible to the user,
;; and how to deal with modifications.
;;
;; Delete               Delete the file or directory from the user's
;;                      stub bottle. Note that this policy has the
;;                      potential of deleting whole directory
;;                      hierarchies and should thus be used with
;;                      caution.
;;                      ** Use with caution **
;;
;; Ignore               Ignore the file or directory.
;;                      Matched files and directories will not be copied
;;                      to the user's bottle stub, and will be ignored
;;                      if they are found in there.
;;                      Note that since directories are skipped
;;                      entirely, this policy causes their contents to
;;                      be ignored too.
;;
;; Link                 Link the user's file to the managed bottle's
;;                      file. Directories are copied.
;;                      This policy is space efficient but makes the
;;                      file read-only. Because of this it should not
;;                      be used for files containing user settings.
;;                      Note that directories are still copied, it is
;;                      only the files they contain that are created as
;;                      links. This is so that the user can add new
;;                      files to these directories.
;;                      ** This is the default policy **
;;
;; LinkDir              Link the user's file or directory to the managed
;;                      bottle's file or directory.
;;                      This is very space efficient, especially for
;;                      directories where it also saves on inode usage.
;;                      However it makes the whole directory read-only,
;;                      thus preventing the user from adding / removing
;;                      any file to / from it.
;;                      ** Use with caution **
;;
;; Copy                 Copies the file to the user's stub bottle
;;                      This increases disk usage but makes the files
;;                      modifiable by the user and is thus required
;;                      when they contain user settings.
;;                      If the managed bottle's file is then modified,
;;                      the user's file will not be updated unless the
;;                      'ReplaceFiles' option is used (see below).
;;
;; Registry             Marks the file as a registry file.
;;                      Registry files are copied to the user's stub
;;                      bottle but allow changes in the managed bottle's
;;                      registry to be merged at the individual key /
;;                      value level.
;;                      Unless the 'ReplaceFiles' option is used, only
;;                      new keys and values are merged to the user's
;;                      registry. This preserves the user's settings
;;                      for that registry file.
;;                      If you wish to overwrite the registry file
;;                      wholesale, use the 'Copy' policy.
;;                      ** To be used only on registry files **
;;
;; For the 'Link', 'LinkDir', 'Copy' and 'Registry' policies,
;; one can specify extra options specifying what to do if the user
;; file no longer matches the managed bottle's file. To do so specify
;; one of the following after a comma:
;;
;; ReplaceFiles         This option applies to files only.
;;                      It specifies that the content of the managed
;;                      bottle's file should replace the content of the
;;                      user's file whenever managed bottle's file is
;;                      modified.
;;                      For the 'Registry' policy, this applies at the
;;                      individual registry key / value level so that
;;                      the managed bottle's keys / values are added or
;;                      replace the user's key / values. However any
;;                      extra key / value created by the user is
;;                      preserved.
;;                      Finally this specifies that if a file violates
;;                      policy (for instance it was copied but the
;;                      current policy specifies it should be a link),
;;                      then remedial action will be taken.
;;
;; ReplaceDirs          Directories violating policy will be replaced.
;;                      For instance if the policy dictates linking to
;;                      the managed bottle's directory but a copy is
;;                      found instead, then the directory will be
;;                      deleted and replaced with a link.
;;                      Note that this option has the potential of
;;                      deleting whole directory trees and should thus
;;                      be used with caution.
;;
;; ReplaceConflicting   If set, then files that should be directories or
;;                      vice versa will be replaced.
;;
;; Finally, note that if more than one regular expression matches a
;; given file name, then the first one is used.
;; Thus the order of the rules below is important.

;;
;; MIMEIgnoreList       A ':'-separated list of MIME Types to ignore.
;;                      You can use this setting to prevent Netscape
;;                      plugins from handling MIME Types for which your

;;
;; CrossOver uses a server process to load Windows plugins.
;; The following parameters can be used to control that server process.
;;
;; * WARNING *
;;   These are advanced parameters and should be changed
;;   with caution, or not at all
;; * WARNING *
;;
;;
;; ServerStartup        Specifies whether the server should always be
;;                      started immediately on browser launch (faster,
;;                      value 'immediate'), or startup should be
;;                      deferred until actual plugin use (less memory,
;;                      value 'deferred').
;;
;;                      Default:    deferred
;;
;; ServerShutdown       This setting lets you decide how long to keep
;;                      the plugin server in memory when it is not
;;                      being used. You can combine this with Server
;;                      Startup to make sure the plugin server only
;;                      stays in memory when you need it. The value is
;;                      in seconds and setting it to 0 means the plugin
;;                      server will stay in memory until you close the
;;                      browser.
;;
;;                      Default:    300
;;
;; UnloadDelay          CrossOver has the ability to keep any given
;;                      plugin in memory and ready for action for a
;;                      specified amount of time after the plugin has
;;                      been unloaded by the browser. This optimization
;;                      makes it much faster to go from one QuickTime
;;                      page to another (since we don't tear down and
;;                      restart QuickTime between pages).
;;                      This parameter gives the number of seconds
;;                      we'll wait before unloading an unused Plugin.
;;                      Set to 0 to unload immediately.
;;
;;                      Default:    0
;;
;; ApiTimeout           CrossOver can detect that a Windows plugin has
;;                      stopped responding. When this happens it will
;;                      terminate the plugin, thus restoring control
;;                      to the browser. This setting sets the number of
;;                      seconds to wait for the plugin before declaring
;;                      it dead. If set to 0, then CrossOver will wait
;;                      indefinitely.
;;
;;                      Default:    30
;;
;; AllowXEmbed          CrossOver uses the new XEmbed protocol by
;;                      default if the browser offers it. This setting
;;                      can be set to 0 to disable XEmbed and force the
;;                      use of the legacy Netscape protocol.

;; UserAgent            If set, this string overrides the user agent
;;                      returned by the browser. This can be used for
;;                      plugins that will refuse to work if they do
;;                      not recognize the user agent string.

;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Name                 By default CrossOver uses the plugin's name and
;;                      appends some text to facilitate its
;;                      identification as a CrossOver plugin, and to
;;                      avoid conflicts with the native plugin if any.
;;                      If set to "raw", then the plugin name will be
;;                      used as is. If set to any other value, the
;;                      value will be used as is, for the plugin name.
;;                      This can be used when a web page uses
;;                      JavaScript to check the plugin name.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; Description          If set, this specifies the plugin description
;;                      to be returned to the browser. This can be
;;                      used in case a web page should use JavaScript
;;                      to check the plugin description. Note that
;;                      such a situation has not been encountered yet.
;;                      By default CrossOver builds a description
;;                      string based on the description of the relevant
;;                      windows plugins.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""

;; NOTE:   These variables *can* be specified in the [NSPlugin]
